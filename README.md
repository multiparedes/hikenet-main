# HikeNet WebApp

In this final thesis, we present the development of a social web app oriented to hiking, using modern technologies and applying the knowledge acquired during the degree. 

The objective has been to create a platform that allows users to share routes, tips and experiences related to hiking, thus fostering a cohesive community passionate about nature.

The project addresses both the back-end part, with data management and application logic, and the front-end, with dynamic and adaptive web design. The development process is described, from the definition of the objectives to the implementation and user testing, ensuring a satisfactory user experience and a clean and maintainable code structure.
